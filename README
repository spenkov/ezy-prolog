EZY Prolog is a simple prolog to learn due to full compatibility with Turbo Prolog and built-in learning center.
EZY Prolog learning center provides quick access to predicate declaration and samples, including puzzles demonstrating AI programming using EZY Prolog.
EZY Prolog is prolog interpeter written completely in Visual Prolog (5.2).
Original source was ported from Tubro Prolop PIE project (Prolog inference engine) into Windows environment.
This site runs CGI version of EZY Prolog on Apache Web server (under WINDOWS).
You need Visual Prolog 5.2 to compile executableProlog is good for educational and research purposes.

EZY Prolog is an interpreter and supports Tubro Prolog syntax.
As an interpreter EZY Prolog is not typed programming language.
System includes Visual Prolog compiler to verify code syntax and logic according to Visual Prolog rules and detect logical errors before programm execution.
Visual Prolog compiler checks type of domains and predicates, flow patters, unused variables (same as Turbo Prolog, Visual Prolog)
Built-in compiler reduces the time programmers need to make working programm.
EZY Prologs combines power of domains and predicates types with the flexibility of interpreter.
